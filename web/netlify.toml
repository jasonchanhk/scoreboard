# - Edge Functions: netlify/edge-functions/ (Deno runtime, runs at edge)
#   - og-image.ts: Generates preview images using og_edge (better for images)

# Route scoreboard view URLs to the function for crawler detection
# The function will serve HTML with meta tags for crawlers, or let browsers through to SPA
